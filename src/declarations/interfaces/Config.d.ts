  ## Geolocation Options

  ### [Geolocation] Common Options

  | Option      | Type      | Note                              |
  |-------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
  | [[desiredAccuracy]] | [[LocationAccuracy]] | __Default: [[BackgroundGeolocation.DESIRED_ACCURACY_HIGH]]__. Specify the desired-accuracy of the geolocation system.  |
  | [[distanceFilter]] | `Integer` | __Default: `10`__.  The minimum distance (measured in meters) a device must move horizontally before an update event is generated. |
  | [[disableElasticity]] | `Boolean` | __Default: `false`__.  Set true to disable automatic speed-based [[distanceFilter]] elasticity. eg: When device is moving at highway speeds, locations are returned at ~ 1 / km. |
  | [[elasticityMultiplier]] | `Float` | __Default: `1`__.  Controls the scale of automatic speed-based `distanceFilter` elasticity.  Increasing `elasticityMultiplier` will result in few location samples as speed increases. |
  | [[stopAfterElapsedMinutes]] | `Integer`  | __Default: `0`__.  The plugin can optionally automatically stop tracking after some number of minutes elapses after the [[BackgroundGeolocation.start]] method was called. |
  | [[stopOnStationary]] | `Boolean`  | __Default: `false`__.  The plugin can optionally automatically stop tracking when the `stopTimeout` timer elapses. |
  | [[desiredOdometerAccuracy]] | `Integer`  | __Default: `100`__.  Location accuracy threshold in **meters** for odometer calculations. |
  | [[useSignificantChangesOnly]] | `Boolean` | __Default: `false`__.  Defaults to `false`.  Set `true` in order to disable constant background-tracking.  A location will be recorded only several times / hour. |
  | [[disableLocationAuthorizationAlert]] | `Boolean` | __Default: `false`__.  Disables automatic authorization alert when plugin detects the user has disabled location authorization.  You will be responsible for handling disabled location authorization by listening to the `providerchange` event.|

  |-------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
  | [[stationaryRadius]] | `Integer`  | __Default: `25`__.  When stopped, the minimum distance the device must move beyond the stationary location for aggressive background-tracking to engage. |
  | [[locationAuthorizationAlert]] | `Object` | When you configure the plugin [[locationAuthorizationRequest]] `Always` or `WhenInUse` and the user *changes* that value in the app's location-services settings or *disables* location-services, the plugin will display an Alert directing the user to the **Settings** screen. |
  | [[showsBackgroundLocationIndicator]] | `Boolean` | A `boolean` indicating whether the status bar changes its appearance when an app uses location services in the background with `Always` authorization. |


  ### [Geolocation] Android Options

    * ### ‚ö†Ô∏è  quoting `String` data.
    *
    * The plugin does not automatically apply double-quotes around `String` data.  The plugin will attempt to JSON encode your template exactly

    * @example
    * ```json
    * {"timestamp": 2018-01-01T12:01:01.123Z}
    * ```
    *
    * The correct `locationTemplate` is:
    * @example
    * ```typescript
    * BackgroundGeolocation.ready({
    *   locationTemplate: '{"timestamp": "<%= timestamp %>"}'
    * });
    * ```
    *
    * @example
    * ```json
    * {"timestamp": "2018-01-01T12:01:01.123Z"}
    * ```
    *
    * ### Configured [[extras]]:
    *
    * If you've configured [[extras]], these key-value pairs will be merged *directly* onto your location data.  For example:
    *
    * @example
    * ```typescript
    * BackgroundGeolocation.ready({
    *   httpRootProperty: 'data',
    *   locationTemplate: '{"lat":<%= latitude %>,"lng":<%= longitude %>}',
    *   extras: {
    *     "foo": "bar"
    *   }
    * )
    * ```
    *
    * Will result in JSON:
    * @example
    * ```json
    * {
    *     "data": {
    *         "lat":23.23232323,
    *         "lng":37.37373737,

    *     "1-7 15:00-16:00",
    *     "1-7 17:00-18:00",
    *     "2,4,6 19:00-22:00"
    *   ]
    * });
    * ```
    *
    * ### Literal Dates
    *
    * The schedule can also be configured with a literal start date of the form:
    * @example
    *
    * ```
    *   "yyyy-mm-dd HH:mm-HH:mm"
    * ```
    *
    * @example
  	* ```typescript
    * BackgroundGeolocation.ready({
    *   schedule: [
    *     "2018-01-01 09:00-17:00"
    *   ]
    * });
    * ```
    *
    * Or **two** literal dates to specify both a start **and** stop date:
    * @example
    *
    * ```
    *   "yyyy-mm-dd-HH:mm yyyy-mm-dd-HH:mm"
    * ```
    *
    * @example
  	* ```typescript
  	*
    * schedule: [
    *     "2018-01-01-09:00 2019-01-01-17:00"  // <-- track for 1 year
    *   ]
    * ```
    *
    * ## Scheduling Geofences-only or Location + Geofences Tracking
    *
    * You can choose to schedule either geofences-only ([[BackgroundGeolocation.startGeofences]]) or location + geofences ([[BackgroundGeolocation.start]]) tracking with each configured schedule by appending the text `geofence` or `location` (default):
    *
    * In the following schedule, the SDK will engage *location + geofences* tracking between 9am to 5pm.  From 6pm to midnight, only *geofences* will be monitored.
    *
    * ```typescript
    * schedule: [
    *   "1-7 09:00-17:00 location",
    *   "1-7 18:00-12:00 geofence"
    * ]
    * ```
    *
    * Since `location` is the default tracking-mode, it can be omitted:
    *
    * ```typescript
    * schedule: [
    *   "1-7 09:00-10:00",  // <-- location is default
    *   "1-7 10:00-11:00 geofence"
    *   "1-7 12:00-13:00",
    *   "1-7 13:00-14:00 geofence"
    * ```
    *
    * ### iOS
    *
    * - iOS **cannot** evaluate the Schedule at the *exact* time you configure &mdash; it can only evaluate the **`schedule`** *periodically*, whenever your app comes alive.
    * - When the app is running in a scheduled **off** period, iOS will continue to monitor the low-power, [significant location changes API (SLC)](https://developer.apple.com/reference/corelocation/cllocationmanager/1423531-startmonitoringsignificantlocati?language=objc) in order to ensure periodic schedule evaluation.  **SLC** is required in order guarantee periodic schedule-evaluation when you're configured [[stopOnTerminate]] __`false`__, since the iOS Background Fetch API is halted if user *manually* terminates the app.  **SLC** will awaken your app whenever a "significant location change" occurs, typically every `1000` meters.  If the `schedule` is currently in an **off** period, this location will **not** be persisted nor will it be sent to the [[BackgroundGeolocation.onLocation]] event &mdash; only the **`schedule`** will be evaluated.
    * - When a **`schedule`** is provided on iOS, it will be evaluated in the following cases:
    *   - Application `pause` / `resume` events.
    *   - Whenever a location is recorded (including **SLC**)
    *   - Background fetch event
    *
    * ### Android
    *
    * The Android Scheduler uses [`AlarmManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager#setExactAndAllowWhileIdle(int,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)) and *typically* operates on-the-minute.
    *
    * ### ‚ÑπÔ∏è See also:

    * ## Android 11+ (with `targetSdkVersion 30+`)
    *
    * Just as in iOS 13/14, Android 11 has [changed location authorization](https://developer.android.com/preview/privacy/location) and no longer offers the __`[Allow all the time]`__ button on the location authorization dialog.  Instead, Android now offers a hook to present a custom dialog to the user where you will explain exactly why you require _"Allow all the time"_ location permission.
    *
    * This dialog can forward the user directly to your application's __Location Permissions__ screen, where the user must *explicity* authorize __`[Allow all the time]`__.  The Background Geolocation SDK will present this dialog, which can be customized with [[Config.backgroundPermissionRationale]].
    * - Android will offer the [[Config.backgroundPermissionRationale]] dialog __just once__.  Once the user presses the `positiveAction` on the dialog, it will __not__ be shown again (pressing `[Cancel]` button does not count).
    * - If the user resets your application's _Location Permissions_ to __`[Ask every time]`__, the [[Config.backgroundPermissionRationale]] _can_ be shown once again.
