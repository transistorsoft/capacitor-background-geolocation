    * ## iOS
    *
    * When this property contains 0 or a positive number, the value in the altitude property is plus or minus the specified number of meters. When this property contains a negative number, the value in the altitude property is invalid.
    *
    * Determining the [altitudeAccuracy] requires a device with GPS capabilities. Thus, on some devices, this property always contains a negative value.
    *
    * ## Android
    *
    * Android defines vertical accuracy at 68% confidence. Specifically, as 1-side of the 2-sided range above and below the estimated altitude reported by [altitude], within which there is a 68% probability of finding the true altitude.
    *
    * In the case where the underlying distribution is assumed Gaussian normal, this would be considered 1 standard deviation.
    *
    * For example, if [altitude] returns `150`, and [verticalAccuracy] returns `20` then there is a 68% probability of the true altitude being between `130` and `170` meters.
